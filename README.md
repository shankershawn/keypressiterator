# keypressiterator

The input of the program is A B C D ..... Y Z .. where A B C D are the KeyCodes to be executed. X is the number of iterations to be performed for the given KeyCode set. Z is the time interval in milliseconds between each keypress. It is a good practice to set the time interval within the range of 300-500.

e.g. 9 9 9 32 100 400

This means Tab key will be pressed three times followed by the space key once. The iteration count is 100 and 400 is the millisecond time gap between each keypress.
